Abstract:

A large part of deep learning research has been dedicated to human speech, but the ability to identify human speech can be more useful as well. This master thesis, is dedicated to modern solution based on research for recognizing multiple emotions from human voice tone in the audio signal. The thesis proposes the modified BEL Model that combined ANFIS and GRU for emotion recognition. This BEL Model inspired by the limbic system of the human brain is a learning model to recognise multiple emotions in human voice in dynamic situations. In this model, ANFIS has been used to develop the model in subsystems of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex.  In recent times, success has been achieved in deep learning in the multi-label classification with the end-to-end learning framework. In this thesis, I have used neural network framework with the standard cross entropy loss function for my multi-label cognitive classification and proper analysis of label relations into the cross-entropy loss. The experimental results show that my proposed model performs better than other multi-label emotion deep learning classifications due to lack of multi-label cognitive classification models, in both classification performance and computational efficiency.
